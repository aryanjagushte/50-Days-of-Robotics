# 50 days of robotics

**Introduction**

I am an Automation and Robotics undergraduate, who found important concepts in robotics while exploring the engineering. I am starting a 50 days challenge which will save a lot of time of students and enthusiasts interested in robotics by providing a fixed path. This is a package of experience of mine as well as what I learnt from different people, courses and off course my college. ALL THE 50 DAYS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE as VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE (Channel : Aryan Jagushte) as a playlist.
