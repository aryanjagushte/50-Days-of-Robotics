## What is Robotics?

**Simple Definition:** Robotics is the technology we use to build robots.

**Technical Definition:** Robotics is the combination of **electronics**, **mechanical engineering**, and **computer engineering**.

**Key Principle:** Robotics is a broad field—the focus of this series is on what's important so you can learn faster.

## Core Components of Robotics

Robotics is built on three interconnected pillars. None can be skipped as they are interdependent:

### 1. Electronics

Components that form the hardware backbone of a robot:

- **Microcontrollers & Microprocessors** - The "brain" of the robot
- **Controllers & Control Systems** - Manage robot behavior and responses
- **Driving Systems** - Motor drivers, power management
- **Sensors** - Input devices (cameras, distance sensors, encoders, etc.)
- **Actuators** - Output devices (motors, servos, pneumatic systems, etc.)

### 2. Design

Physical structure and CAD modeling:

- **Primary Tool:** Fusion 360 (3D modeling software)

**Why Fusion 360?**
- Easy conversion to URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Cleaner conversion process compared to other CAD software (SolidWorks, etc.)
- Fewer errors during the CAD-to-simulation conversion

**Outcome:** Robot structural design optimized for simulation and hardware implementation

### 3. Coding

Software control and automation:

**Primary Language: Python**
- Widely used in robotics
- Ideal for computer vision applications
- Easier learning curve for beginners

**Secondary Language: C++**
- Used where performance and efficiency are critical
- More prevalent in ROS/ROS2 applications

**Purpose:** Control robot movements and automate behavior based on sensors and algorithms
