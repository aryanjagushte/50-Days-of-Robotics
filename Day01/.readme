Day 1 introduces the fundamentals of robotics and breaks down the structure of the 50-day challenge. This is a collaborative learning initiative with no basic prerequisites required. Whether you're a complete beginner or have some foundational knowledge, you can join the community and learn together.

##What is Robotics?
**Simple Definition:** Robotics is the technology we use to build robots.

**Technical Definition:** Robotics is the combination of electronics, mechanical engineering, and computer engineering.

**Key Principle:** Robotics is a broad field—the focus of this series is on what's important so you can learn faster.

##Core Components of Robotics
Robotics is built on three interconnected pillars. None can be skipped as they are interdependent:

1. Electronics
Components that form the hardware backbone of a robot:

Microcontrollers & Microprocessors - The "brain" of the robot

Controllers & Control Systems - Manage robot behavior and responses

Driving Systems - Motor drivers, power management

Sensors - Input devices (cameras, distance sensors, encoders, etc.)

Actuators - Output devices (motors, servos, pneumatic systems, etc.)

2. Design
Physical structure and CAD modeling:

Primary Tool: Fusion 360 (3D modeling software)

Why Fusion 360?

Easy conversion to URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

Cleaner conversion process compared to other CAD software (SolidWorks, etc.)

Fewer errors during the CAD-to-simulation conversion

Outcome: Robot structural design optimized for simulation and hardware implementation

3. Coding
Software control and automation:

Primary Language: Python

Widely used in robotics

Ideal for computer vision applications

Easier learning curve for beginners

Secondary Language: C++

Used where performance and efficiency are critical

More prevalent in ROS/ROS2 applications

Purpose: Control robot movements and automate behavior based on sensors and algorithms

##Key Features:
Pace: Starts slow with basics, then gradually increases in difficulty

Balance: Mix of theoretical concepts and practical application

Coverage: Introduction to both ROS 1 and ROS 2

Projects: Both simulation-based and hardware-based projects
